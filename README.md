# script_for_BNFO653

This script is for the teaching purpose of BNFO653 at VCU. 

16s rRNA reads table and a metadata are needed as the input. Alpha and beta diversities will be analysized and results will be exported automatically.

Before using the script, raw data need to be analysized on Galaxy (https://usegalaxy.org/) to get a reads table. You can find a step-by-step tutorial here (https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metagenomics/tutorials/mothur-miseq-sop/tutorial.html).
